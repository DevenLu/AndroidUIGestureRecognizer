# AndroidUIGestureRecognizer
AndroidGestureRecognizer is an Android implementation  of the Apple's UIGestureRecognizer framework

# From Apple API reference:
> UIGestureRecognizer is an abstract base class for concrete gesture-recognizer classes. A gesture-recognizer object—or, simply, a gesture recognizer—decouples the logic for recognizing a gesture and acting on that recognition. When one of these objects recognizes a common gesture or, in some cases, a change in the gesture, it sends an action message to each designated target object.
